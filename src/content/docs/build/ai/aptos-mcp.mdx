# Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a server that provides a set of tools, prompts, and resources to help
developers build applications on the Aptos blockchain. It is designed to be used with AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code,
and others that support the Model Context Protocol.
