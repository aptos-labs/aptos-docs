# Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Aptos Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a server that provides a set of tools, prompts, and resources to help
developers build applications on the Aptos blockchain. It is designed to be used with AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code,
and others that support the Model Context Protocol.

## Getting Started

We've provided guides for Cursor and Claude Code to help you integrate the Aptos MCP into your development environment.
If you're using a different AI tool, follow the steps for your favorite AI tool, and refer to the documentation for
Cursor or Claude Code for examples.
