The Aptos Blockchain network can be accessed by several APIs, depending on your use-case.

## Aptos Fullnode



import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';



This API - embedded into Fullnodes - provides a simple, low latency, yet low-level way of _reading_ state and
_submitting_ transactions to the Aptos Blockchain. It also supports transaction simulation.

  <LinkCard href="/build/apis/fullnode-rest-api-reference?network=testnet" title="Aptos Fullnode REST API (Testnet)" description="Testnet API playground for Aptos Fullnode REST API" />

  <LinkCard href="/build/apis/fullnode-rest-api-reference?network=devnet" title="Aptos Fullnode REST API (Devnet)" description="Devnet API playground for Aptos Fullnode REST API" />

## Indexer



<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    href="/build/indexer"
    title="Indexer GraphQL API"
    description="This GraphQL API offers a high-level, opinionated GraphQL interface to read state from the Aptos Blockchain.
It's ideal for interacting with NFTs, Aptos Objects, or custom Move contracts.
Learn more about the Indexer-powered GraphQL API here."
  />

  <LinkCard
    href="/build/indexer/txn-stream"
    title="Transaction Stream API"
    description="This GRPC API streams historical and real-time transaction data to an indexing processor.
It's used by Aptos Core Indexing and can also support custom app-specific indexing processors
for real-time blockchain data processing. Learn more here."
  />
</CardGrid>



## Faucet (Only Testnet/Devnet)



<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    href="/build/apis/faucet-api"
    title="Faucet API"
    description="This API provides the ability to receive test tokens on devnet. Its primary purpose is the development
and testing of applications and Move contracts before deploying them to mainnet. On testnet you can mint at the mint page."
  />
</CardGrid>



The code of each of the above-mentioned APIs is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core). As
such anyone can operate these APIs and many independent operators and builders worldwide choose to do so.

### Aptos Labs operated API Deployments

[Aptos Labs](https://aptoslabs.com) operates a deployment of these APIs on behalf of [Aptos Foundation](https://aptosfoundation.org/)
for each [Aptos Network](/network/nodes/networks) and makes them available for public consumption.

At the moment there are 2 sets of Aptos Labs API deployments:

1. [APIs with anonymous access and IP-based rate-limiting](/network/nodes/networks)
2. [[Beta] APIs with authentication and developer-account based rate limiting through the Aptos Labs Developer Portal](/build/apis/aptos-labs-developer-portal)
