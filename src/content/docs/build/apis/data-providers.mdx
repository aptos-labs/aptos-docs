# Data Providers

In addition to the API run by Aptos full nodes, we also provide a few different ways to get Aptos blockchain data.

## Overview of aptos data endpoints

[REST API](/build/apis/fullnode-rest-api) allows you to query the full node directly and will have the latest data (historical data will be missing unless it's an archival full node).

[GRPC transaction stream](/build/indexer/txn-stream/aptos-hosted-txn-stream) is a stream layer we built that serves typed version of above data

[GraphQL](/build/indexer) is an endpoint where we provide product tables (such as transfers and balances) that can be queried

Product tables are parsed out from transaction and logic is [public](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2),
some vendors have implemented similar parsing logic to create a subset of tables and made them available to query.

## SQL Tables

Indexer (the stack that powers our GraphQL endpoint) defines several processors that create different product tables in Postgres.

This type of data is often used for analytics since it allows for aggregations.

### Core tables

These contain raw data very similar to what is found in REST API. Note that (transaction) version is often used instead of transaction hash.

- Blocks - version, block height, epoch, timestamp
- Transactions - version, type, sender, entry function, gas
- Signatures - signature types, signer, fee payer address
- Events - type and data for events

On chain data is stored as: [table items](/build/smart-contracts/table), [resources](/network/blockchain/resources) or [modules](/build/smart-contracts/modules-on-aptos) (executable)

- (write set) changes - change index, change type (write or delete on what type of data), resource address
- Table items - table key, table handle, decoded key (content and type), value (content and type)
- (move) resources - resource address, resource type, data
- (move) modules - bytecode for deployed modules, friends and exposed functions

## Vendors for core tables and metrics:

We have a few options that will let you access this data using SQL or UIs for building dashboards.

### Google bigquery public dataset

Provides data through [google public data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/crypto-aptos-mainnet-us)

We also have sample analytics queries [using the above resources](https://github.com/aptos-labs/explorer/tree/main/analytics)

### Dune

We have a dashboard here: https://dune.com/aptos/aptos-chain-metrics-overview

### Allium

Data source for many downstream vendors such as defillama and rwa.xyz. Raw data is available: https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/supported-blockchains/move-ecosystem/aptos
They also have transfers for stablecoins https://docs.allium.so/historical-data/stablecoins#stablecoin-metrics

### Artemis

Provides [topline metrics](https://app.artemis.xyz/asset/aptos) as well as chart builder

### Nansen

Provides [topline metrics](https://app.nansen.ai/macro/blockchains?chain=aptos) with additional functionality with account.

### Sentio

They have a [guide](https://docs.sentio.xyz/docs/aptos) and 
data is found in data source -> external project  -> sentio/aptos-overview
They also provide [stack tracing](https://app.sentio.xyz/explorer) of transactions

### RWA.xyz

High level metrics for RWAs in [dashboard](https://app.rwa.xyz/networks/aptos).
You'll need to make an account to access stablecoin details.

### Pangea

Provides [raw data](https://docs.pangea.foundation/api-reference/aptosvm/reference),
coin/fa transfers, and some dex parsing.

### Other vendors

We also have some partners who target more enterprise use cases

- [Token Terminal](https://tokenterminal.com/resources/articles/aptos-data-partnership)
- [The Tie](https://www.thetie.io/insights/news/introducing-aptos-ecosystem-dashboard-and-on-chain-data/)

## Vendors for real-time data

- [Geomi](https://geomi.dev/) (prev. Aptos Build)
  - Provides [API key](https://geomi.dev/docs/start) for higher rate limits on REST API and GRPC transaction stream.
  - Provides [no code indexing](https://geomi.dev/docs/no-code-indexing) to parse and turn events into tables that can be queried.
- [NODEREAL](https://nodereal.io/aptos) for REST API endpoint
- [SHINAMI](https://docs.shinami.com/reference/api-references-overview) for REST API and GraphQL endpoints
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/apt) for REST API endpoint
