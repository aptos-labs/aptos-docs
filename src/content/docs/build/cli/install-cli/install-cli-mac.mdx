For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation



<Steps>

1. Ensure you have brew installed https://brew.sh/.

2. Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   brew update
   brew install aptos
   ```

3. Open another terminal and run aptos help to verify the CLI is installed.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   aptos help
   ```

</Steps>

  If `brew` does not work for you, you can try the steps here: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](/build/cli/install-cli/install-cli-specific-version)

# Upgrading the CLI

Upgrading the CLI with brew just takes 2 commands:

```bash filename="Terminal"
brew update
brew upgrade aptos
```
