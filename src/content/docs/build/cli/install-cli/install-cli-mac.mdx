# Install the Aptos CLI on Mac

For Mac, the easiest way to install the Aptos CLI is with the package manager `brew`.

# Installation

<Steps>

1. Ensure you have `brew` installed https://brew.sh/.

2. Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.
    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    brew update
    brew install aptos
    ```

3. Open another terminal and run `aptos help` to verify the CLI is installed.
    ```bash filename="Terminal"
    aptos help
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
If `brew` does not work for you, you can try the steps here: [Install Specific Aptos CLI Versions (Advanced)](install-cli-specific-version.mdx)
