<Aside title="Note">
  This guide is for advanced users who need to build and install a specific version of the Aptos CLI.

  If you are looking to install a specific version of the Aptos CLI, we suggest you use ASDF or Mise to handle it for you.
  You can see the installation guide [here](/build/install-cli/install-cli-asdf)
</Aside>

If you need a specific version of the Aptos CLI, you can build it directly from the Aptos source code. This installation
method is primarily used to interact with specific features on Devnet which may not have made it to Testnet / Mainnet
yet. You may also want to follow these steps if you are running an architecture which does not play well with the
existing releases / pre-compiled binaries.

If you do not need this advanced method, you can find the normal install steps [here](/build/cli).

## Install on macOS / Linux

<Steps>
  1. Checkout the Aptos source code.

     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git
     ```

  2. Ensure you have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) installed.

  3. Build the Aptos CLI:

     ```sh
     cargo build --package aptos --profile cli
     ```

     The binary will be available at `target/cli/aptos`.

  4. (Optional) Move this executable to a place in your PATH.

  5. Verify the installation worked.

     ```sh
     target/cli/aptos help
     ```

     These help instructions also serve as a useful detailed guide for specific commands.
</Steps>

## Install on Windows

<Steps>
  1. Checkout the Aptos source code.

     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git
     ```

  2. Ensure you have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) installed.

  3. Build the Aptos CLI.

     ```powershell

     The binary will be available at `target\cli\aptos.exe`.

  4. (Optional) Move this executable to a place in your PATH.

  5. Verify the installation worked.

     ```powershell
