A common way to learn a new framework or programming language is to build a simple todo list. In this tutorial, we will learn how to build an end-to-end todo list dapp, starting from the smart contract side through the front-end side and finally use of a wallet to interact with the two.

See the completed code in the [source-code](https://github.com/aptos-labs/developer-docs/tree/main/apps/nextra/pages/en/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp).

## Chapters

After meeting the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [getting set up](#setup) as described below, you will follow this tutorial in this order:

1. [Create a smart contract](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract)
2. [Set up a frontend](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/2-set-up-the-frontend)
3. [Fetch Data from Chain](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/3-fetch-data-from-chain)
4. [Submit data to chain](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/4-submit-data-to-chain)
5. [Handle Tasks](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/5-handle-tasks)

## Prerequisites

You must have:

- [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Although we will explain some React decisions, we are not going to deep dive into how React works; so we assume you have some previous experience with React.

## Setup

In this section, we will create an API key using [Geomi](https://geomi.dev/) and create a `my-first-dapp` directory to hold our project files, both client-side code (React based) and the Move code (our smart contract).

First let's create an API key using [Geomi](https://geomi.dev/).

<Steps>
  1. **Visit Geomi**: Go to [geomi.dev](https://geomi.dev/) in your web browser.

  2. **Sign up or Log in**: Create a new account or log in to your existing Geomi account.

  3. **Create a new project**: Click on "Create New Project" to create a new project and name it `my-first-dapp`.

  4. **Navigate to API Resource tab**: Navigate to the API Resource tab in your dashboard.

  5. **Create New API Resource**: Name it `my-first-dapp-api` and set the network to `Devnet`.

  6. **Configure API Key**: Since we will be using the API key in our web app, toggle on `Client usage`. Here you can configure allowed URLs and extension IDs that can use the API key. Set `Allowed URLs` to `http://localhost:5173/`, which is the development server we will be using. Also set `Per IP rate limit` to `10,000`

  7. **Copy and Save**: Now you have your API key. Copy the key as we will be using it in the next step.

</Steps>

Next, we will be using [create-aptos-dapp](/build/create-aptos-dapp) to create the project.

<Steps>
  1. **Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory** for the project (for example, the `Desktop` directory).

  2. **Run the create-aptos-dapp command** to create the project:
     ```shellscript filename="Terminal"
     npx create-aptos-dapp@latest
     ```

  3. **Follow the instructions to create the project** with these settings:
     - Choose a name for the project, for example `my-first-dapp`
     - Choose the `Full-stack project` option
     - Choose the `Boilerplate Template` option
     - For simplicity, choose not to use Surf
     - Choose the `Vite app` framework option
     - Choose the `Devnet` network option
</Steps>

The tool will create the project in a directory with the same name as the project and install the required dependencies.

Follow the `Next Steps` instructions.

Now let's [create a smart contract](/build/guides/build-e2e-dapp/1-create-smart-contract).
