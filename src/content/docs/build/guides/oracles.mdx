This reference guide presents various Oracles that you can utilize while building on Aptos. Oracles supply offchain data to the blockchain, enabling smart contracts to access a diverse range of information.

## Chainlink 

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance. 

The only all-in-one oracle platform for creating workflows across blockchains and legacy systems while embedding critical data, compliance and privacy capabilities, which are then represented as a single line of code that runs in a verifiable decentralized runtime.

Many of the world’s largest financial services institutions and DeFi protocols have adopted Chainlink’s standards and infrastructure.

### Chainlink Data Feeds

By adopting the Chainlink standard for high-quality data, Aptos now has seamless access to the tamper-proof data needed to support the development of highly secure applications on the network.

Chainlink Data Feeds provide a secure, reliable, and decentralized source of real-world data to power unique smart contract use cases across decentralized and traditional finance.

1. Data providers aggregate raw price data from a multitude of centralized and decentralized exchanges, accounting for time, volume, and outliers.
2. Independent Chainlink nodes fetch market price data from various data providers and combine the results into an aggregated value.
3. Multiple Chainlink nodes then aggregate their results together offchain to generate an ‘oracle report’, which is made available to smart contracts.

### Chainlink CCIP

Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is the standard for interoperability. CCIP enables developers to build secure cross-chain applications that can transfer tokens, send messages, and initiate actions across blockchains. Through the [Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard](https://blog.chain.link/ccip-v-1-5-upgrade/), CCIP enables token developers to integrate new and existing tokens with CCIP in a self-serve manner within minutes, without requiring vendor lock-in, hard-coded functions, or external dependencies that may limit future optionality. CCTs support self-serve deployments, full control and ownership for developers, zero-slippage transfers, and enhanced programmability via configurable rate limits and reliability features such as Smart Execution. CCIP is powered by Chainlink decentralized oracle networks (DONs)—a proven standard with a track record of securing tens of billions of dollars and enabling over $25 trillion in onchain transaction value.

**Key CCIP developer tools**:
- [CCIP Directory](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/aptos-mainnet) - view all relevant addresses and details needed to use Aptos with CCIP.
- [CCIP official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) — start integrating CCIP into your cross-chain application.
- [CCIP Token Manager](https://tokenmanager.chain.link/) — an intuitive front-end web interface for the deployment of new and management of existing CCTs by their developers, including no-code guided deployments and configuration tools. 
- [CCIP SDK](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/ccip-javascript-sdk) — a software development kit that streamlines the process of integrating CCIP, allowing developers to use JavaScript to create a token transfer frontend dApp. 

## Pyth Network

The [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) is one of the largest first-party Oracle network, delivering real-time data across [a vast number of chains](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses).

The network comprises some of the world’s [largest exchanges, market makers, and financial services providers](https://pyth.network/publishers). These publish proprietary data on-chain for aggregation and distribution to smart contract applications.

### How to Use Pyth Real-Time Data in Aptos Contracts

This guide explains how to use real-time Pyth data in Aptos applications.

### Configuring the `Move.toml` file

Add the Pyth Contract to your project dependencies in the `Move.toml` file:

```toml copy
[dependencies]
Pyth = { git = "https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain.git", subdir = "target_chains/aptos/contracts", rev = "main" }
```

The named addresses of `pyth`, `wormhole`, and `deployers` must be defined at compile time. These addresses are used to interact with the Pyth contract on Aptos.

```toml copy
[addresses]
pyth = "0x7e783b349d3e89cf5931af376ebeadbfab855b3fa239b7ada8f5a92fbea6b387"
deployer = "0xb31e712b26fd295357355f6845e77c888298636609e93bc9b05f0f604049f434"
wormhole = "0x5bc11445584a763c1fa7ed39081f1b920954da14e04b32440cba863d03e19625"
```

Consult [Aptos Contract Addresses](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/aptos) for the complete list of contract addresses on different Aptos networks.

## Write Contract Code

The code snippet below provides an example module fetching the BTC/USD price from Pyth price feeds:

```rust {21} copy
module example::example {
    use pyth::pyth;
    use pyth::price::Price;
    use pyth::price_identifier;
    use aptos_framework::coin;

    // Add the pyth_price_update argument to any method on your contract that needs to read the Pyth price.
    // See https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/fetch-price-updates for more information on how to fetch the pyth_price_update.
    public fun get_btc_usd_price(user: &signer, pyth_price_update: vector<vector<u8>>): Price {

        // First update the Pyth price feeds
        let coins = coin::withdraw(user, pyth::get_update_fee(&pyth_price_update));
        pyth::update_price_feeds(pyth_price_update, coins);

        // Read the current price from a price feed.
        // Each price feed (e.g., BTC/USD) is identified by a price feed ID.
        // The complete list of feed IDs is available at https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids
        // Note: Aptos uses the Pyth price feed ID without the `0x` prefix.
        let btc_price_identifier = x"e62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43";
        let btc_usd_price_id = price_identifier::from_byte_vec(btc_price_identifier);
        pyth::get_price(btc_usd_price_id)
    }
}

```

<Aside type="note" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `pyth_price_update` argument contains verified prices from Pyth. Calling
  `pyth::update_price_feeds` with this value updates the on-chain Pyth price and
  ensures your application has recent price data. The pyth\_price\_update can be
  fetched from Hermes; Consult [Fetch Price Updates](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/fetch-price-updates) for
  more information on how to fetch the `pyth_price_update`.
</Aside>

The code snippet above does the following things:

1. Call `pyth::get_update_fee` to get the fee required to update the Pyth price feeds.
2. Call `pyth::update_price_feeds` and pass `pyth_price_update` to update the Pyth price feeds.
3. Call `pyth::get_price` to read the current price, providing the [price feed ID](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) you wish to read.
