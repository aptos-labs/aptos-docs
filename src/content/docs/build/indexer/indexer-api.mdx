# Indexer API Access

Aptos Labs hosts a public version of the Indexer GraphQL API that anyone can use to get basic historical and aggregate data about transactions, fungible assets, and tokens from on-chain. 

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.

You can also access the API via the GraphQL endpoints below. For more information on the format of data in each field / table, please see the [table reference page](./indexer-api/indexer-reference.mdx).

## SDK Access (Primary Method)

The primary way to use the Indexer is to access it through the [TypeScript SDK](../sdks/ts-sdk/fetch-data-via-sdk.mdx).

The TypeScript SDK will automatically handle rate limits, and can seamlessly allow for both [Fullnode REST API](../apis/fullnode-rest-api.mdx) access and Indexer access depending on what data is needed.

## Hasura Explorer (Manual Queries)

## GraphQL API Endpoints (Direct Access)

If you need to directly make GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, then use the following endpoints:

- **Mainnet:** `https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Testnet:** `https://api.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`
- **Devnet:** `https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/graphql`

### Rate limits

The following rate limit applies for the Aptos Labs hosted indexer API:

- For a web application that calls this Aptos-provided indexer API directly from the client (for example, wallet or explorer), the rate limit is currently 5000 requests per five minutes by IP address. **Note that this limit can change with or without prior notice.**

If you need a higher rate limit, consider the following solutions:

1. Get an API Key from [API Gateway](https://developers.aptoslabs.com/).
2. Run the Aptos Indexer API yourself. See the guide to self-hosting [here](./txn-stream/self-hosted.mdx).
