<Aside type="note">
  The NFT Aggregator API is currently in beta. If you're building an aggregator or need real-time event streaming via gRPC, please reach out to our team for early access and support!
</Aside>

We're building a **universal NFT aggregator** for the Aptos ecosystem - normalized activity across all major marketplaces, including **Tradeport**, **Wapal**, **Bluemove**, **Rarible**, and more. We also maintain historical data for deprecated marketplaces like **Topaz**.

At its core, the aggregator captures marketplace events in real-time (like listings, token offers, and collection-wide offers) and converts them into clean, structured data. This allows developers to work with a unified data format â€” no need to handle different marketplace-specific formats manually.

## What We Provide

- **[GraphQL API](/build/indexer/nft-aggregator/graphql-api)** for querying activities
- **[Analytics REST API](/build/indexer/nft-aggregator/analytics-api)** for aggregated analytics
- Marketplace integration support for new partners

Our API supports two main use cases:

- **Historical Data tracking:** Listings, NFT Token Offers, NFT Collection Offers â€” in real-time.
- **Analytics & Trends:** Aggregate data, market insights, top traders, and more.

## GraphQL API

Query real-time marketplace activity across all integrated marketplaces. Use this for:

- Basic historical data
- Aggregated data (e.g. how many listings are there for a given collection)

You can explore it by hand by viewing the Hasura Explorer below for the network you are interested in.

- Hasura Console: https://console.nft-aggregator-staging.gcp.aptosdev.com/console/api/api-explorer

For direct GraphQL queries to the Aptos-Labs hosted Indexer API, use these endpoints:

- Mainnet Graphql Endpoint: https://api.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/nft-aggregator-staging/v1/graphql

you can find the full API reference [here](/build/indexer/nft-aggregator/graphql-api).

## Analytics REST API

<Aside type="note">
  Analytics API is currently in beta.\
  For custom analytics pipelines, we recommend using our gRPC stream for raw structured events.
</Aside>

Get high-level insights and historical data on the NFT market. Use this analytics API for:

- Total sales volumes
- Top buyers and sellers
- Marketplace trends

You can find the full API reference [here](/build/indexer/nft-aggregator/analytics-api).

## Integrated Marketplaces

See the full list of marketplaces currently integrated with the NFT Aggregator [here](/build/indexer/nft-aggregator/marketplaces).

## Add Your Marketplace

<Aside type="note">
  We handle most integrations directly with your support
</Aside>

If you'd like your marketplace to be included, please reach out to our team. We support both public integrations and private beta partners.
