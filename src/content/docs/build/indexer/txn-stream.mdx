{/* <IndexerBetaNotice></IndexerBetaNotice> */}

The Transaction Stream Service is a service that listens to the Aptos blockchain and emits transactions as they are processed. These docs explain how this system works, how to use the Labs-Hosted instance of the service, and how to deploy it yourself.

You can get API access to a transaction stream hosted by Aptos Labs [here](/build/indexer/txn-stream/aptos-hosted-txn-stream).
