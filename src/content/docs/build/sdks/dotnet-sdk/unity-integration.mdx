# Integrating into Unity projects

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating the Aptos .NET SDK.

<Steps>

1. Install the Aptos Unity SDK
    #

2. Option 1: Import via Unity Package Manager (UPM)
    1. Open Package Manager window (Window | Package Manager)
    2. Click + button on the upper-left of a window, and select _Add package from git URL..._
    3. Enter the following URL and click Add button
    ```bash
    https://github.com/aptos-labs/unity-sdk.git?path=/Packages/com.aptoslabs.aptos-unity-sdk
    ```
    #

3. Option 2: Import via `unitypackage`
    1. Go to the [`aptos-labs/unity-sdk Releases`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/unity-sdk/releases) and download the latest release.
    2. Drag and drop the `.unitypackage` file into your Unity project.

4. Use the Aptos SDK
    Import the `Aptos` namespace in your C# script and use the SDK.
    ```csharp {2-2,8-8,11-15}
    using UnityEngine;
    using Aptos;
    class Example : MonoBehaviour
    {
    public void Start()
    {
    PrintLedgerInfo();
    }
    async void PrintLedgerInfo() {
    var client = new AptosUnityClient(Networks.Mainnet);
    var ledgerInfo = await client.Block.GetLedgerInfo();
    Debug.Log(ledgerInfo.BlockHeight);
    }
    }
    ```

</Steps>
