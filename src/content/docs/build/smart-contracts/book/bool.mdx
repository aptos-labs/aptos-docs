`bool` is Move's primitive type for boolean `true` and `false` values.

## Literals

Literals for `bool` are either `true` or `false`.

## Operations

### Logical

`bool` supports three logical operations:

| Syntax | Description                  | Equivalent Expression                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `&&`   | short-circuiting logical and | `p && q` is equivalent to `if (p) q else false`  |
| `\|\|` | short-circuiting logical or  | `p \|\| q` is equivalent to `if (p) true else q` |
| `!`    | logical negation             | `!p` is equivalent to `if (p) false else true`   |

### Control Flow

`bool` values are used in several of Move's control-flow constructs:

- [`if (bool) { ... }`](../../../../build/smart-contracts/book/conditionals)
- [`while (bool) { .. }`](../../../../build/smart-contracts/book/loops)
- [`assert!(bool, u64)`](../../../../build/smart-contracts/book/abort-and-assert)

## Ownership

As with the other scalar values built into the language, boolean values are implicitly copyable,
meaning they can be copied without an explicit instruction such as
[`copy`](../../../../build/smart-contracts/book/variables.mdx#move-and-copy).
