Constants are a way of giving a name to shared, static values inside of a `module` or `script`.

The constant's must be known at compilation. The constant's value is stored in the compiled module
or script. And each time the constant is used, a new copy of that value is made.

## Declaration

Constant declarations begin with the `const` keyword, followed by a name, a type, and a value. They
can exist in either a script or module

```text
const <name>: <type> = <expression>;
```

For example

```move
script {
  const MY_ERROR_CODE: u64 = 0;

  fun main(input: u64) {
    assert!(input > 0, MY_ERROR_CODE);
  }
}

module 0x42::example {
  const MY_ADDRESS: address = @0x42;

  public fun permissioned(s: &signer) {
    assert!(std::signer::address_of(s) == MY_ADDRESS, 0);
  }
}
```

## Naming

Constants must start with a capital letter `A` to `Z`. After the first letter, constant names can
contain underscores `_`, letters `a` to `z`, letters `A` to `Z`, or digits `0` to `9`.

```move
script {
  const FLAG: bool = false;
  const MY_ERROR_CODE: u64 = 0;
  const ADDRESS_42: address = @0x42;
}
```

Even though you can use letters `a` to `z` in a constant. The
[general style guidelines](/build/smart-contracts/book/coding-conventions) are to use just uppercase letters `A` to `Z`,
with underscores `_` between each word.

This naming restriction of starting with `A` to `Z` is in place to give room for future language
features. It may or may not be removed later.

## Visibility

`public` constants are not currently supported. `const` values can be used only in the declaring
module.

## Valid Expressions

Currently, constants are limited to the primitive types `bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `u256`, `address`, and
`vector<u8>`. Future support for other `vector` values (besides the "string"-style literals) will
come later.

### Values

Commonly, `const`s are assigned a simple value, or literal, of their type. For example

```move
script {
  const MY_BOOL: bool = false;
  const MY_ADDRESS: address = @0x70DD;
  const BYTES: vector<u8> = b"hello world";
  const HEX_BYTES: vector<u8> = x"DEADBEEF";
}
```

### Complex Expressions

In addition to literals, constants can include more complex expressions, as long as the compiler is
able to reduce the expression to a value at compile time.

Currently, equality operations, all boolean operations, all bitwise operations, and all arithmetic
operations can be used.

```move
script {
  const RULE: bool = true && false;
  const CAP: u64 = 10 * 100 + 1;
  const SHIFTY: u8 = {
    (1 << 1) * (1 << 2) * (1 << 3) * (1 << 4)
  };
  const HALF_MAX: u128 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 / 2;
  const REM: u256 = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968 % 654321;
  const EQUAL: bool = 1 == 1;
}
```

If the operation results in a runtime exception, the compiler will give an error that it is
unable to generate the constant's value

```move
script {
  const DIV_BY_ZERO: u64 = 1 / 0; // error!
  const SHIFT_BY_A_LOT: u64 = 1 << 100; // error!
  const NEGATIVE_U64: u64 = 0 - 1; // error!
}
```

Note that constants cannot currently refer to other constants. This feature, along with support for
other expressions, will be added in the future.

## Builtin Constants

Builtin constants are predefined named values which can be used from anywhere in the code. The following constants are supported:

_since language version 2.2_

| Name                            | Value                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `__COMPILE_FOR_TESTING__: bool` | `true` when compiling unit tests, `false`  otherwise |

_since language version 2.3_

| Name             | Value               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `MAX_U8: u8`     | 2<sup>8</sup> - 1   |
| `MAX_U16: u16`   | 2<sup>16</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_U32: u32`   | 2<sup>32</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_U64: u64`   | 2<sup>64</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_U128: u128` | 2<sup>128</sup> - 1 |
| `MAX_U256: u256` | 2<sup>256</sup> - 1 |
| `MAX_I8: i8`     | 2<sup>7</sup> - 1   |
| `MAX_I16: i16`   | 2<sup>15</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_I32: i32`   | 2<sup>31</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_I64: i64`   | 2<sup>63</sup> - 1  |
| `MAX_I128: i128` | 2<sup>127</sup> - 1 |
| `MAX_I256: i256` | 2<sup>255</sup> - 1 |
| `MIN_I8: i8`     | -2<sup>7</sup>      |
| `MIN_I16: i16`   | -2<sup>15</sup>     |
| `MIN_I32: i32`   | -2<sup>31</sup>     |
| `MIN_I64: i64`   | -2<sup>63</sup>     |
| `MIN_I128: i128` | -2<sup>127</sup>    |
| `MIN_I256: i256` | -2<sup>255</sup>    |

A builtin constant can be shadowed by a user declaration. For example, the below code is valid in language version 2.3, and the builtin constant will simply be shadowed:

```move
module 0x44::m {
   const MAX_U8: u8 = 255; // User defined constant shadowing builtin constant
}
```
