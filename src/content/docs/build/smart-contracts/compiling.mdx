<Aside type="note">
  Ensure that your [CLI](/build/cli) is up to date before compiling.

## `aptos move compile`

Once you have a package set up, you can compile your Move code by doing:

```bash filename="Terminal"
aptos move compile
```

If run successfully, you should receive a Terminal output like so

```bash filename="Terminal"
{
  "Result": [
    "<PUBLISHING_ADDRESS>::<MODULE_NAME>"
  ]
}
```

<Aside type="note">
  You may need to add named addresses, especially for examples.  For example, with the Hello Blockchain Move example, you will need to add the `hello_blockchain` named address:

  ```bash filename="Terminal"
  aptos move compile --named-addresses hello_blockchain=default
  ```

## Unpacking Build

Compiled Move packages contain a folder structure that resembles the one below.



<FileTree>

- build/
  - package_name/
    - bytecode_modules/
      - dependencies/
      - module_name.mv
    - source_maps/
      - dependencies/
      - module_name.mvsm
    - sources/
      - dependencies/
      - module_name.move
    - BuildInfo.yaml
- scripts/
- sources/
  - module_name.move
- tests/
- Move.toml

</FileTree>



### `bytecode_modules`

The bytecode modules folder contains the compiled Move bytecode for your module(s) (such as `module_name.mv`).
To learn more about the bytecode and its security features, see [why move?](/build/smart-contracts/why-move)

### `source_maps`

The source maps folder contains source maps (such as `module_name.mvsm`) which allow
users to map the compiled bytecode back to the source code and relevant dependencies.
