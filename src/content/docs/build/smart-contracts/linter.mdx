The "Aptos Move Lint" tool runs on a Move package to find and warn about common issues in Move programs, helping improve your Move code.

You can run it with the aptos CLI command: `aptos move lint`.

If you find any issues, please submit [bugs and feedback](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/issues/new?title=%5Blinter%5D%20%3CDescriptive%20Title%3E\&body=%3CDetailed%20description%20of%20the%20issue%20or%20feature%20request%3E\&labels=move-linter\&projects=aptos-labs/16). Also, we are tracking ideas and prioritization requests for new lint rules [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/issues/15221), we welcome your contributions.

## Lint Checks

### `aborting_overflow_checks`

Checks for patterns that resemble overflow checks done in C code:

```move
// Overflow check
if (x > x + y) {
  abort 1;
};

// Underflow check
if (x < x - y) {
  abort 1;
};
```

Such checks in Move do not make sense, as they either abort immediately or always return true/false.

### `almost_swapped`

Checks for expression patterns that look like a failed swap attempt and notifies the user. These patterns are likely erroneous code. This currently only detects simple access patterns such as assignments to a variable or a field of a struct. Examples include:

- `a = b; b = a;` which can be correctly swapped with `(a, b) = (b, a);`
- `a.x = b.x; b.x = a.x;` which can be correctly swapped with `(a.x, b.x) = (b.x, a.x);`

### `assert_const`

Checks for trivial assertions, including `assert!(true)` and `assert!(false)`. The former can be replaced by an abort, while the latter is equivalent to a no-op, which can be removed entirely.

### `avoid_copy_on_identity_comparison`

Checks for identity comparisons (`==` or `!=`) between copied values of type `vector` or `struct` (i.e., types for which copy can be expensive). It instead suggests to use reference-based identity comparison instead (i.e., use `&x == &y` instead of `x == y`, when the above mentioned conditions meet).

[This recommendation](/build/smart-contracts/book/equality#avoid-extra-copies) is also given in the Move book. Due to automatic copy inference, it may not be obvious when a copy is being made while using `==` or `!=` on values with types that have the `copy` ability. This lint identifies cases where extra copies on vectors or structs could be skipped by using reference-based identity comparisons.

### `blocks_in_conditions`

Checks for use of blocks in conditions (e.g., in `if`, `match`, and `while` conditions), which can make code hard to read. An example coding pattern caught by this lint is:

```move
if ({let x = foo(); !x}) { // uses a block in condition
  bar();
}
```

Such code can usually be rewritten to hoist the block out and above the condition, usually making it more readable.

It is a common Move pattern to provide inline specifications in conditions, especially loop invariants, which requires creating blocks in conditions. We exclude this pattern in the lint check to continue to allow for this specification pattern.

Note that an `assert!` is translated to a conditional abort, so blocks in `assert!` condition also are reported by this lint.

### `empty_if`

Checks for `if` statements that have no body, such as:

```move
if (x) {
}
```

### `equal_operands_in_bin_op`

Checks for binary operations with identical operands. For example, `x % x`, `x ^ x`,  `x > x`, `x >= x`, `x == x`, `x | x`, `x & x`, `x / x`, and `x != x` are all caught by this lint. The lint also suggests replacing these with a simplified value or expression, such as `0`, `true`, or `false`.

### `empty_range`

Checks for empty ranges in `for` loops, such as `for i in 0..0 { ... }`, which do not execute the loop body. This can happen when the start of the range is greater than or equal to the end of the range, resulting in an empty iteration.

### `unnecessary_cast`

Checks for unnecessary type casts where the source expression already has the target type. These casts are redundant and can be removed to improve code readability.

For example:

```move
let x: u64 = 42;
let y = x as u64; // unnecessary cast, x is already u64
```

can be simplified to:

```move
let x: u64 = 42;
let y = x; // cast removed
```

### `known_to_abort`

Checks for expressions where the use of constant values will violate runtime constraints and abort the execution.

Specifically, the following patterns are detected:

- **Bit shifts with excessive shift amounts**: `x << n` or `x >> n` where `n` is a constant that is greater than or equal to the bit width of `x`'s type. For example, `value << 64`, when `value` has type `u64`, will always abort.
- **Division or modulo by zero**: `x / 0` or `x % 0` operations will always abort at runtime.
- **Out-of-range type casting**: `constant as type` where the `constant` value is outside the representable range of the target `type`. For example, `300 as u8` will abort since `u8` can only represent values 0-255.

### `needless_bool`

Checks for patterns of the form (where `x` is any arbitrary boolean expression):

- `if (x) true else false`, which can be replaced with just `x`.
- `if (x) false else true`, which can be replaced with just `!x`.
- `if (x) { return true } else { return false }`, which can be replaced with just `return x`.
- `if (x) { return false } else { return true }`, which can be replaced with just `return !x`.
- `if (x) true else true` or `if (x) false else false`, which should be rewritten to remove the redundant branch.

### `needless_deref_ref`

Checks for patterns where references taken are immediately dereferenced, and suggests removing the pair of dereference-reference operators:

- `*&x.f` can be simplified to `x.f`
- `*&mut x.f` can be simplified to `x.f`
- `*&mut x.f = 5;` can be simplified to `x.f = 5;`

### `needless_loops`

Checks for loops that always exit on their first iteration, making the loop construct unnecessary. This lint detects loops that immediately return, abort, or break without performing any meaningful iteration.

The linter identifies these patterns:

- Loops where the first instruction is `return`, `abort`, or `break`
- Loops where the first instruction is a conditional branch where both paths immediately exit the loop

Examples of needless loops:

```move
// Always returns on first iteration
loop {
    return 42;
}

// Always aborts on first iteration
loop {
    abort 1;
}
```

These can be simplified by removing the loop construct entirely and using just the exit statement directly.

This lint uses conservative analysis to avoid false positives, only flagging cases where the exit behavior is immediately obvious from the loop's structure.

### `needless_mutable_reference`

Checks for mutable references or borrows (currently: mutable reference parameters, mutable borrow of locals, `borrow_global_mut`) that are not used mutably, and suggests to use the immutable reference or borrow instead.

For example, in the function `foo` below, `&mut` can be replaced by `&` because the reference is not mutably used.

```move
fun foo(x: u64): u64 {
  let y = &mut x;
  *y
}

```

### `needless_ref_deref`

Checks for patterns where immutable reference are taken for a dereference, and suggests removing the pair of reference-dereference operators: `&*x` can be simplified to `x`.

### `needless_ref_in_field_access`

Checks for patterns where there are needless references taken when accessing a field of a struct or an enum, and suggests removing the explicit reference taken:

- `(&s).f` can be simplified to `s.f`
- `(&mut s).f = 42;` can be simplified to `s.f = 42;`

### `needless_return`

Checks for unnecessary `return` statements. This lint detects unnecessary return statements where the value can be returned directly without using the `return` keyword.
For example, the following function:

```move
public fun foo(): bool {
  // ...
  return true;
}
```

can be simplified to:

```move
public fun foo(): bool {
  // ...
  true
}
```

### `nested_if`

Checks for nested if statements that can be simplified using the `&&` operator. This lint identifies patterns where an inner if statement with no else branch is contained within an outer if statement that also has no else branch.

```move
if (a) {
    if (b) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

This pattern can be simplified to:

```move
if (a && b) {
    // some code
}
```

The simplified version is more readable and avoids unnecessary nesting while maintaining the same logical behavior.

### `nonminimal_bool`

Check for boolean expressions that can be simplified when a boolean literal (either `true` or `false`) is part of a binary or unary boolean operator. Examples:

- `x && true` is logically equivalent to `x`
- `x || true` is logically equivalent to `true`
- `x => false` is logically equivalent to `!x`
- `x <==> true` is logically equivalent to `x`
- `! true` is logically equivalent to `false`

Does NOT consider side-effects/short-circuiting in the recommended simplifications. Example:

- `1/0 || true` is logically equivalent to `true`, but applying this simplification affects program semantics.

### `no_op`

Checks for statements that can be removed without changing program behavior. Examples:

- `42;`
- `*(&mut 0) = /*...*/;`
- `x << 4;`

Note that the linter does not take into account possible aborts due to arithmetic errors. If a statement is flagged it's almost definitely a programmer mistake, but you should evaluate the code in question to understand the intent. Sometimes the proper fix is to remove the statement, sometimes the statement should be changed.

### `self_assignment`

Checks for patterns where a variable or a field of a struct is assigned to itself and suggests removing the assignment. These assignments do not affect the state of the program. Examples include:

- `let x = x;`
- `x = x;`
- `a.x = a.x;`

### `simpler_bool_expression`

Checks for boolean patterns that can be simplified through different boolean algebra laws. Examples include:

- Absorption law:
  - `a && b || a` can be simplified to `a`
  - `a || a && b` can be simplified to `a`
- Idempotence:
  - `a && a` can be simplified to `a`
  - `a || a` can be simplified to `a`
- Contradiction
  - `a && !a` can be simplified to `false`
  - `!a && a` can be simplified to `false`
- Tautology:
  - `a || !a` can be simplified to `true`
  - `!a || a` can be simplified to `true`
- Distributive law:
  - `(a && b) || (a && c)` can be simplified to `a && (b || c)`
  - `(a || b) && (a || c)` can be simplified to `a || (b && c)`

where `a`, `b` and `c` can either be simple or composed expressions.

### `simpler_numeric_expression`

Checks for various patterns where a simpler numeric expression can be used instead. In all these cases, the code must already type check, and `x` can be any numeric expression.

- `x & 0`, `x * 0`, `0 & x`, `0 * x`, `0 << x`, `0 >> x`, `x % 1` can all be replaced with just `0`.
- `x | 0`, `x ^ 0`, `x >> 0`, `x << 0`, `x + 0`, `x - 0`, `x / 1`, `x * 1`, `0 | x`, `0 ^ x`, `0 + x`, `1 * x` can all be replaced with just `x`.

### `unnecessary_boolean_identity_comparison`

Checks for boolean identity comparisons of the form:

- `x == true`, `true == x`, which can be replaced with just `x`.
- `x == false`, `false == x`, which can be replaced with just `!x`.

In all these cases, `x` can be any arbitrary boolean expression.

### `unnecessary_numerical_extreme_comparison`

Checks if there are any numerical comparisons with extreme values (i.e., min and max value representable by that numeric type) that are unnecessary or can be made more precise and clear. Depending on the comparison, various recommendations are made.

Consider the following example expressions that are caught by the lint, and the corresponding recommendations made (in all these cases, `x` is a place holder for a numerical expression of type `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, or `u256`, and `MAX` is a place holder for the max value representable for that numeric type):

- `x < 0`, `0 > x`, `x > MAX`, `MAX < x`, are always false, rewrite code to remove this comparison
- `x >= 0`, `0 <= x`, `x <= MAX`, `MAX >= x`, are always true, rewrite code to remove this comparison
- `x <= 0`, `0 >= x`, `x >= MAX`, `MAX <= x`, can all be simplified to use `==` instead
- `x > 0`, `0 < x`, `x < MAX`, `MAX > x`, can all be clarified to use `!=` instead

### `while_true`

Checks for `while (true) { .... }` patterns and suggests using the more explicit `loop { .... }` construct instead.

## Suppressing Lint Warnings

To suppress one or more lint checks named `check1`, `check2`, ... (and so on), you can add the attribute `#[lint::skip(check1, check2, ...)]` to a function or a module. The linter will then not perform the checks named `check1`, `check2`, ... (and so on) for that function or module.

For example, the function below would usually get a warning from the linter about a `needless_bool`, but due to the attribute on the function, the linter does not emit a warning.

```move
#[lint::skip(needless_bool)]
fun violation(): bool {
    if (foo()) true else false
}
```

## Experimental Checks

### `cyclomatic_complexity`

Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent execution paths through a function. A high value generally correlates with code that is harder to test and maintain.

This linter performs an approximation while traversing the Move expression tree:

1. The complexity score starts at **1**.
2. The score is incremented for each control-flow decision point found:
   - +1 for each `if`
   - +1 for each `else if`
   - +1 for each `loop`, `while`, or `for`
   - +1 for each `break` or `continue`
   - +1 for each `return` statement that is not the final expression in the function
   - +n where n = (number of match arms - 1)

When the accumulated score exceeds the default threshold (currently **10**), the linter emits a diagnostic suggesting that the function be simplified or decomposed.
