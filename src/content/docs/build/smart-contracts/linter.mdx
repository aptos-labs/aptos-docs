The "Aptos Move Lint" tool runs on a Move package to find and warn about common issues in Move programs, helping improve your Move code.

You can run it with the aptos CLI command: `aptos move lint`.

If you find any issues, please submit [bugs and feedback](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/issues/new?title=%5Blinter%5D%20%3CDescriptive%20Title%3E\&body=%3CDetailed%20description%20of%20the%20issue%20or%20feature%20request%3E\&labels=move-linter\&projects=aptos-labs/16). Also, we are tracking ideas and prioritization requests for new lint rules [here](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/issues/15221), we welcome your contributions.

## Lint Checks

### `aborting_overflow_checks`

Checks for patterns that look like overflow checks done in a C style:

```move
// Overflow check
if (x > x + y) {
  abort 1;
};

// Underflow check
if (x < x - y) {
  abort 1;
};
```

This pattern in Move does not make sense, as it either aborts immediately or is always true/false.

### `almost_swapped`

Checks for expression patterns that look like a failed swap attempt and notifies the user. These patterns are likely erroneous code. This currently only detects simple access patterns such as assignments to a variable or a field of a struct. Examples include:

- `a = b; b = a;` which can be correctly swapped with `(a, b) = (b, a);`
- `a.x = b.x; b.x = a.x;` which can be correctly swapped with `(a.x, b.x) = (b.x, a.x);`

### `assert_const`

Checks for trivial assertions, i.e. `assert!(false)` and `assert!(true)`. The latter is equivalent to a no-op, so can be removed entirely, while the former can be replaced by an abort.

### `avoid_copy_on_identity_comparison`

Checks for identity comparisons (`==` or `!=`) between copied values of type `vector` or `struct` (i.e., types for which copy can be expensive). It instead suggests to use reference-based identity comparison instead (i.e., use `&x == &y` instead of `x == y`, when the above mentioned conditions meet).

[This recommendation](/build/smart-contracts/book/equality#avoid-extra-copies) is also given in the Move book. Due to automatic copy inference, it may not be obvious when a copy is being made while using `==` or `!=` on values with types that have the `copy` ability. This lint identifies cases where extra copies on vectors or structs could be skipped by using reference-based identity comparisons.

### `blocks_in_conditions`

Checks for use of blocks in conditions (e.g., in `if`, `match`, and `while` conditions), which can make code hard to read. An example coding pattern caught by this lint is:

```move
if ({let x = foo(); !x}) { // uses a block in condition
  bar();
}
```

Such code can usually be rewritten to hoist the block out and above the condition, usually making it more readable.

It is a common Move pattern to provide inline specifications in conditions, especially loop invariants, which requires creating blocks in conditions. We exclude this pattern in the lint check to continue to allow for this specification pattern.

Note that an `assert!` is translated to a conditional abort, so blocks in `assert!` condition also are reported by this lint.

### `empty_if`

Checks for `if` statements that have no body, which is likely a mistake. For example:

```move
if (x) {
}
```

### `equal_operands_in_bin_op`

Checks for binary operations where both operands are the same, which is likely a mistake. For example `x % x`, `x ^ x`,  `x > x`, `x >= x`, `x == x`, `x | x`, `x & x`, `x / x`, and `x != x` are all caught by this lint. The lint suggests replacing these with a more appropriate value or expression, such as `0`, `true`, or `false`.

This lint does not catch cases where the operands are vector access.

### `empty_range`

Checks for empty ranges in `for` loops, such as `for i in 0..0 { ... }`, which do not execute the loop body. This can happen when the start of the range is greater than or equal to the end of the range, resulting in an empty iteration.

### `find_unnecessary_casts`

Checks for unnecessary type casts where the source expression already has the same type as the target type. These casts are redundant and can be removed to improve code readability.

For example:

```move
let x: u64 = 42;
let y = x as u64; // unnecessary cast, x is already u64
```

The above can be simplified to:

```move
let x: u64 = 42;
let y = x; // cast removed
```

### `infinite_recursion`

Checks for functions or groups of functions that recurse infinitely. Note that the linter cannot detect _conditional_ infinite recursion, only inconditional, so a flag is a definite error in the program.

### `known_to_abort`

Checks for expressions that will always abort at runtime due to known constant values that violate runtime constraints. This lint helps identify code that will deterministically fail before it reaches production.

The following cases are detected:

- **Bit shifts with excessive shift amounts**: `x << n` or `x >> n` where `n` is a constant that is greater than or equal to the bit width of `x`'s type. For example, `value << 64` when `value` is of type `u64` will always abort.
- **Division or modulo by zero**: `x / 0` or `x % 0` operations will always abort at runtime.
- **Out-of-range type casting**: `constant as type` where the `constant` value is outside the representable range of the target `type`. For example, `300 as u8` will abort since `u8` can only represent values 0-255.

### `needless_bool`

Checks for patterns of the form (where `x` is any arbitrary boolean expression):

- `if (x) true else false`, which can be replaced with just `x`.
- `if (x) false else true`, which can be replaced with just `!x`.
- `if (x) { return true } else { return false }`, which can be replaced with just `return x`.
- `if (x) { return false } else { return true }`, which can be replaced with just `return !x`.
- `if (x) true else true` or `if (x) false else false`, which should be rewritten to remove the redundant branch.

### `needless_deref_ref`

Checks for patterns where references taken are immediately dereferenced, and suggests removing the pair of dereference-reference operators:

- `*&x.f` can be simplified to `x.f`
- `*&mut x.f` can be simplified to `x.f`
- `*&mut x.f = 5;` can be simplified to `x.f = 5;`

### `needless_loops`

Checks for loops that always exit on their first iteration, making the loop construct unnecessary. This lint detects loops that immediately return, abort, or break without performing any meaningful iteration.

The linter identifies these patterns:

- Loops where the first instruction is `return`, `abort`, or `break`
- Loops where the first instruction is a conditional branch where both paths immediately exit the loop

Examples of needless loops:

```move
// Always returns on first iteration
loop {
    return 42;
}

// Always aborts on first iteration
loop {
    abort 1;
}
```

These can be simplified by removing the loop construct entirely and using just the exit statement directly.

This lint uses conservative analysis to avoid false positives, only flagging cases where the exit behavior is immediately obvious from the loop's structure.

### `needless_mutable_reference`

Checks for mutable references or borrows (currently: mutable reference parameters, mutable borrow of locals, `borrow_global_mut`) that are not used mutably, and suggests to use the immutable reference or borrow instead.

For example, in the function `foo` below, `&mut` can be replaced by `&` because the reference is not mutably used.

```move
fun foo(x: u64): u64 {
  let y = &mut x;
  *y
}

```

### `needless_ref_deref`

Checks for patterns where immutable reference are taken for a dereference, and suggests removing the pair of reference-dereference operators: `&*x` can be simplified to `x`.

### `needless_ref_in_field_access`

Checks for patterns where there are needless references taken when accessing a field of a struct or an enum, and suggests removing the explicit reference taken:

- `(&s).f` can be simplified to `s.f`
- `(&mut s).f = 42;` can be simplified to `s.f = 42;`

### `needless_return`

Checks for unnecessary `return` statements in functions that can be simplified. This lint identifies cases where a `return` statement is used to return a value that can be directly returned without the `return` keyword.
For example, the following function:

```move
public fun foo(): bool {
  // ...
  return true;
}
```

This pattern can be simplified to:

```move
public fun foo(): bool {
  // ...
  true
}
```

### `nested_if`

Checks for nested if statements that can be simplified using the `&&` operator. This lint identifies patterns where an inner if statement with no else branch is contained within an outer if statement that also has no else branch.

```move
if (a) {
    if (b) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

This pattern can be simplified to:

```move
if (a && b) {
    // some code
}
```

The simplified version is more readable and avoids unnecessary nesting while maintaining the same logical behavior.

### `nonminimal_bool`

Check for boolean expressions that can be simplified when a boolean literal (either `true` or `false`) is part of a binary or unary boolean operator. Examples:

- `x && true` is logically equivalent to `x`
- `x || true` is logically equivalent to `true`
- `x => false` is logically equivalent to `!x`
- `x <==> true` is logically equivalent to `x`
- `! true` is logically equivalent to `false`

Does NOT consider side-effects/short-circuiting in the recommended simplifications. Example:

- `1/0 || true` is logically equivalent to `true`, but applying this simplification affects program semantics.

### `no_op`

Checks for statements that can be removed without changing program behavior. Examples:

- `42;`
- `*(&mut 0) = /*...*/;`
- `x << 4;`

Note that the linter does not take into account possible aborts due to arithmetic errors. If a statement is flagged it's almost definitely a programmer mistake, but you should evaluate the code in question to understand the intent. Sometimes the proper fix is to remove the statement, sometimes the statement should be changed.

### `random_modulo`

Checks for expressions of the form `u{8|16|32|64|128|256}_integer() % x`. Getting the remainder of a division where the dividend is a random number results in a non-uniform distribution, which could affect the fairness of a contract's behavior, depending on how the value is used. For example, the result of `u8_integer() % 255` is twice as likely to be 0 than 1. Instead of wrapping with modulo, `u{8|16|32|64|128|256}_range(0, x)` can be used, which produces a uniform distribution.

### `self_assignment`

Checks for patterns where a variable or a field of a struct is assigned to itself and suggests removing the assignment. These assignments do not affect the state of the program. Examples include:

- `let x = x;`
- `x = x;`
- `a.x = a.x;`

### `simpler_bool_expression`

Checks for boolean patterns that can be simplified through different boolean algebra laws. Examples include:

- Absorption law:
  - `a && b || a` can be simplified to `a`
  - `a || a && b` can be simplified to `a`
- Idempotence:
  - `a && a` can be simplified to `a`
  - `a || a` can be simplified to `a`
- Contradiction
  - `a && !a` can be simplified to `false`
  - `!a && a` can be simplified to `false`
- Tautology:
  - `a || !a` can be simplified to `true`
  - `!a || a` can be simplified to `true`
- Distributive law:
  - `(a && b) || (a && c)` can be simplified to `a && (b || c)`
  - `(a || b) && (a || c)` can be simplified to `a || (b && c)`

Where `a`, `b` and `c` can either be simple or composed expressions.

### `simpler_numeric_expression`

Checks for various patterns where a simpler numeric expression can be used instead. In all these cases, the code must already type check, and `x` can be any numeric expression.

- `x & 0`, `x * 0`, `0 & x`, `0 * x`, `0 << x`, `0 >> x`, `x % 1` can all be replaced with just `0`.
- `x | 0`, `x ^ 0`, `x >> 0`, `x << 0`, `x + 0`, `x - 0`, `x / 1`, `x * 1`, `0 | x`, `0 ^ x`, `0 + x`, `1 * x` can all be replaced with just `x`.

### `unnecessary_boolean_identity_comparison`

Checks for boolean identity comparisons of the form:

- `x == true`, `true == x`, which can be replaced with just `x`.
- `x == false`, `false == x`, which can be replaced with just `!x`.

In all these cases, `x` can be any arbitrary boolean expression.

### `unnecessary_numerical_extreme_comparison`

Checks if there are any numerical comparisons with extreme values (i.e., min and max value representable by that numeric type) that are unnecessary or can be made more precise and clear. Depending on the comparison, various recommendations are made.

Consider the following example expressions that are caught by the lint, and the corresponding recommendations made (in all these cases, `x` is a place holder for a numerical expression of type `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, or `u256`, and `MAX` is a place holder for the max value representable for that numeric type):

- `x < 0`, `0 > x`, `x > MAX`, `MAX < x`, are always false, rewrite code to remove this comparison
- `x >= 0`, `0 <= x`, `x <= MAX`, `MAX >= x`, are always true, rewrite code to remove this comparison
- `x <= 0`, `0 >= x`, `x >= MAX`, `MAX <= x`, can all be simplified to use `==` instead
- `x > 0`, `0 < x`, `x < MAX`, `MAX > x`, can all be clarified to use `!=` instead

### `redundant_comparison`

Checks for redundant, contradictory, and tautological numerical comparisons over the same variable in boolean expressions combined with `&&` and `||`. This lint identifies logic errors in conditional statements that can lead to unreachable code or always-true/false conditions.

Examples of patterns caught by this lint:

- **Redundant with `&&`**: `x <= 400 && x < 500` - the second condition is redundant since it's always satisfied when the first is true
- **Contradictory with `&&`**: `x <= 400 && x > 500` - these conditions can never both be true, making the expression always false
- **Redundant with `||`**: `x > 10 || x >= 5` - the first condition is redundant since the second covers more cases
- **Tautology with `||`**: `x < 5 || x >= 5` - this expression is always true for any value of x

The lint only triggers when comparisons are on the same variable and can detect constants on either side of the comparison operator.

### `while_true`

Checks for `while (true) { .... }` patterns and suggests using the more explicit `loop { .... }` construct instead.

## Suppressing Lint Warnings

To suppress one or more lint checks named `check1`, `check2`, ... (and so on), you can add the attribute `#[lint::skip(check1, check2, ...)]` to a function or a module. The linter will then not perform the checks named `check1`, `check2`, ... (and so on) for that function or module.

For example, the function below would usually get a warning from the linter about a `needless_bool`, but due to the attribute on the function, the linter does not emit a warning.

```move
#[lint::skip(needless_bool)]
fun violation(): bool {
    if (foo()) true else false
}
```

## Security Checks

### `contains_in_table`

Checks for unsafe usage of table operations that could lead to runtime errors. This lint helps prevent common mistakes when working with tables by detecting:

1. **Unsafe `table::borrow` calls**: Borrowing from a table without first checking if the key exists using `table::contains`. This can cause runtime errors if the key doesn't exist.

2. **Unsafe `table::add` calls**: Adding to a table without ensuring the key doesn't already exist. This can cause runtime errors if the key already exists.

The lint analyzes control flow to understand when keys are known to exist or not exist based on `table::contains` checks.

**Examples of patterns caught by this lint:**

```move
// Unsafe borrow - no contains check
table::borrow(&table, key); // Error: might fail if key doesn't exist

// Unsafe add - no contains check
table::add(&mut table, key, value); // Error: might fail if key already exists

// Wrong key check
if (table::contains(&table, key1)) {
    table::borrow(&table, key2); // Error: checked key1 but borrowing key2
}

// Wrong branch usage
if (!table::contains(&table, key)) {
    table::borrow(&table, key); // Error: key is known NOT to exist
}
```

**Recommended solutions:**

- For `table::borrow`: Use `table::contains` first to check if the key exists
- For `table::add`: Use `table::upsert` instead, or check with `table::contains` that the key doesn't exist first

### `return_signer`

This security check detects when a public function returns a `signer` value, which can leak authority and is usually a security risk. Returning a `signer` from a public function allows callers to obtain signer capabilities that they shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized operations.

**Examples of patterns caught by this lint:**

```move
// Direct signer return - security risk
public fun get_signer(): signer {
    // ... code that returns a signer
}

// Signer in vector - security risk
public fun get_signers(): vector<signer> {
    // ... code that returns signers
}

// Signer in tuple - security risk
public fun get_data(): (u64, signer) {
    // ... code that returns a tuple with signer
}
```

### `zero_address`

This security check detects the use of `address` parameters in external functions that are not checked for being zero before being used. This could lead to loss of funds or other security issues.⏎

### `return_constructor_ref`

Checks for public functions that return an `ConstructorRef`. Constructor references confer the authority to create an object, and returning them from functions can leak privileged capability. This lint helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive object creation authority.

**Examples of patterns caught by this lint:**

```move
// Public function returning ConstructorRef - security risk
public fun create_object_ref(): ConstructorRef {
    // ... code that returns ConstructorRef
}

// Public function returning a struct containing ConstructorRef
public fun get_authority(): MyStruct<ConstructorRef> {
    // ... code that returns struct with ConstructorRef
}

// Public function returning vector containing ConstructorRef
public fun get_refs(): vector<ConstructorRef> {
    // ... code that returns vector with ConstructorRef
}
```

## Experimental Checks

### `cyclomatic_complexity`

Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent execution paths through a function. A high value generally correlates with code that is harder to test and maintain.

This linter performs an approximation while traversing the Move expression tree:

1. The complexity score starts at **1**.
2. The score is incremented for each control-flow decision point found:
   - +1 for each `if`
   - +1 for each `else if`
   - +1 for each `loop`, `while`, or `for`
   - +1 for each `break` or `continue`
   - +1 for each `return` statement that is not the final expression in the function
   - +n where n = (number of match arms - 1)

When the accumulated score exceeds the default threshold (currently **10**), the linter emits a diagnostic suggesting that the function be simplified or decomposed.
