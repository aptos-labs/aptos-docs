Aptos allows for permissionless publishing of [modules](/build/smart-contracts/book/modules-and-scripts)
within a [package](/build/smart-contracts/book/packages) as well as [upgrading](/build/smart-contracts/book/package-upgrades)
those that have appropriate compatibility policy set.

A module contains several structs and functions, much like Rust.

During package publishing time, a few constraints are maintained:

- Both Structs and public function signatures are published as immutable.
- The `init_module` function plays a crucial role in module initialization:
  - When a module is published for the first time (i.e., the module does not exist on-chain), the VM will search for and execute the `init_module(account: &signer)` function.
  - When upgrading an existing module that is already on-chain, the `init_module` function will NOT be called.
  - The signer of the account that is publishing the module is passed into the `init_module` function.
  - **This function must be private and not return any value.**
  - The `init_module` function can have at most one parameter, and its type must be `&signer`
  - The `init_module` function should not have generic parameters
  - The `init_module` function is commonly used to initialize module-specific data structures or set initial states.

<Aside type="note">
  `init_module` is optional. You only need to implement it if you want to:

  - Initialize module data when publishing a module for the first time
  - Set up initial states or configurations
  - Create resource accounts or other module-specific setup tasks
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  Remember: The `init_module` function will only be called once in a module's lifecycle - when it is first published.
  Subsequent upgrades to the module will not trigger the `init_module` function again.
