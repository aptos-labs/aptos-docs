  <ListCard title="Features" iconName="lightning">
    - [Keyless Accounts](/build/guides/aptos-keyless) Social login: onboard and sign w/o wallets or seed phrases.
    - [NEW! Passkeys](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-66.md) Seamless onboarding; create/recover accounts without mnemonics or private keys. On Apple/Android, passkeys sync across devices.
    - [Sponsored Transactions](/build/guides/sponsored-transactions) Pay for users’ gas so they can use your dApp with zero APT.
    - [NEW! Orderless Transactions](/build/guides/orderless-transactions) Send transactions out of order with a replay‑protection nonce. Bots/machines can sign and submit in parallel without sequence‑number stalls; safe for high‑volume apps.
    - [On-chain Randomness](/build/smart-contracts/randomness) Verifiable random numbers for fair games, lotteries & drops.
    - [Parallel Execution & ~250ms Blocks](/network/blockchain/execution) Block‑STM (Software Transactional Memory) scales throughput with safe, deterministic parallelism; this means efficient execution and fast block time.
