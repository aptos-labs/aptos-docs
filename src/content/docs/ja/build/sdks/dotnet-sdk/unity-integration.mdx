import { Aside, CardGrid, LinkCard, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
  1. Install the Aptos Unity SDK

     #### Option 1: Import via Unity Package Manager (UPM)

     1. Open Package Manager window (Window | Package Manager)
     2. Click + button on the upper-left of a window, and select _Add package from git URL..._
     3. Enter the following URL and click Add button

     ```shellscript
     https://github.com/aptos-labs/unity-sdk.git?path=/Packages/com.aptoslabs.aptos-unity-sdk
     ```

     #### Option 2: Import via `unitypackage`

     1. Go to the [`aptos-labs/unity-sdk Releases`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/unity-sdk/releases) and download the latest release.
     2. Drag and drop the `.unitypackage` file into your Unity project.

  2. Use the Aptos SDK

     Import the `Aptos` namespace in your C# script and use the SDK.

     ```csharp {2-2,8-8,11-15}
     using UnityEngine;
     using Aptos;

     class Example : MonoBehaviour
     {
         public void Start()
         {
             PrintLedgerInfo();
         }

         async void PrintLedgerInfo() {
             var client = new AptosUnityClient(Networks.Mainnet);
             var ledgerInfo = await client.Block.GetLedgerInfo();
             Debug.Log(ledgerInfo.BlockHeight);
         }

     }
     ```
</Steps>
