import { Faucet } from '~/components/react/Faucet';

The Aptos Testnet Faucet lets developers instantly request free APT tokens on the **Aptos testnet**.\
These tokens are for **testing purposes only** — they hold no real-world value and cannot be exchanged for mainnet APT.

Use the faucet to:

- Deploy and test **Move smart contracts**
- Experiment with Aptos SDKs (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and more)
- Build and refine dApps before launching to mainnet

## How to Use the Faucet

1. **Sign in** with your Google account.
2. **Enter your Aptos testnet wallet address**.
3. Click **Request APT** to instantly receive tokens.
4. Check your wallet balance — tokens should appear within a few seconds.

> **Tip:** If you don’t have a testnet account, you can either [Create an Account with the Aptos TypeScript SDK](/build/sdks/ts-sdk/quickstart) (developer method) or [Install an Aptos Wallet and Switch to Testnet](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/wallets) (UI method) to get started.
