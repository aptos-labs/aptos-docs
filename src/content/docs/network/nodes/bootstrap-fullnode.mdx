Bootstrapping a new node usually only depends on [state sync](/network/nodes/configure/state-sync) in its fast sync mode, which synchronizes to a recent state with help from its peers and start syncing recent ledger history from there. However, if longer ledger history is needed for any reason, we have these choices:

- ### [Bootstrap from a Snapshot](/network/nodes/bootstrap-fullnode/bootstrap-fullnode)
- ### [Bootstrap from a Backup](/network/nodes/bootstrap-fullnode/aptos-db-restore)
