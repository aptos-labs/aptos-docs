title: "Deploy a PFN"

The following guides provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a PFN on the Aptos networks.

<Aside type="note">
  **Do I have to run a PFN?**<br />
  If you do not wish to run a PFN, but still want to interact with the Aptos blockchain, you can use the REST API
  provided by the Aptos Labs' PFNs (see [Aptos APIs](/build/apis)). Note, however, that Aptos Labs-provided PFNs have rate
  limits, which can impede your development. If you want to avoid such rate limits, you can deploy your own PFN
  and synchronize with the Aptos blockchain directly.

<Aside type="caution">
  **Choose a network**<br />
  These guides default to deploying a PFN in the Aptos mainnet network, but they can easily be used to do
  the same in other networks (e.g., devnet or testnet network). To do so, check out the desired network branch
  and use the `genesis.blob` and `waypoint.txt` node files for the respective branches:
  [mainnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-mainnet),
  [devnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-devnet), and
  [testnet](/network/nodes/configure/node-files-all-networks/node-files-testnet).
