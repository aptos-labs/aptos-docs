If you want to develop and test your applications on the Aptos blockchain, you can run a
local network (**localnet**). This network will run on your local machine, and will not be
connected to any other Aptos network. Running a localnet is the easiest way to test and
develop Aptos applications, and make changes to the Aptos node software.

## Recommended Steps

Most developers should use the Aptos CLI to run a local development network. This is the simplest
and easiest way to get started. It provides a local deployment that works just like a production network,
including the [Node API](/build/apis), [Transaction Stream](/build/indexer/txn-stream), [Indexer API](/build/indexer) and [Faucet](/build/apis/faucet-api).

To get started, follow this guide: [Localnet using the Aptos CLI](/network/nodes/localnet/local-development-network)

## Specialized Steps

If you're developing the core Aptos node software, or have more complex testing needs, consider the
guides below. The first guide provides a way to run a localnet with a single validator node, and the
second guide provides a way to run a localnet with multiple validator nodes, and validator
fullnodes (VFNs).

To run a localnet with a single validator node, directly from the `aptos-core` source code, follow this guide:

- [Localnet from source code](/network/nodes/localnet/run-a-localnet)

To run a localnet with multiple validator nodes and validator fullnodes (VFNs), follow this guide:

- [Multi-node Localnet](/network/nodes/localnet/run-a-multinode-localnet)
