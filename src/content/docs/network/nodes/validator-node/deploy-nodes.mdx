# Deploy Nodes

Before you can run a validator and validator fullnode (VFN) in an Aptos network, you will need to select a deployment
method for your nodes. The guides below provide step-by-step instructions for deploying a validator node and VFN
on various platforms, and across different Aptos networks.

Once your nodes are deployed, you can connect them to an Aptos network by initializing your staking pool and joining
the validator set. See [Connect Nodes](connect-nodes.mdx) for more information.

<Aside type="caution">
Before selecting a deployment method, make sure to read and understand the [Node Requirements](node-requirements.mdx) first.
